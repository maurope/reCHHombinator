# ReCHHombinator
## Prediction of Crossover Recombination using Methylation Data

This is a Python3 implementation to predict recombination rates in rice using the count of methylated cytosines per 100 kb as the input feature. It uses the "Extra Trees" machine learning model to develop the predictions. Data for two rice varieties "IR64" and "Azucena" are provided. Model is trained with CHH counts from all chromosomes from one variety to predict recombination for each chromosome of the other variety. 

## Usage

A Jupyter notebook [reCHHombinator.ipynb](reCHHombinator.ipynb) contains the code for training the model and analyzing the results.
